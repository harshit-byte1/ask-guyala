# Ask Guyala 🌿♻️

**Ask Guyala** is an educational web platform created for the **Yirrgandji community** to help children (and the wider community) learn proper waste disposal practices.  
The website allows users to type in a specific waste item and instantly find out **which bin** it belongs in — encouraging better waste management habits and reducing littering.

This project was presented at the **Engineers Without Borders (EWB) Challenge 2023**, where it earned a **Finalist Award** representing **Flinders University**.
